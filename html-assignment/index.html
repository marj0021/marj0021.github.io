    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <article>
        <p>My name is Zayd Marjane, I am from Fes, Moro cco and I am 17 years old. I moved to Canada in April this year and it has been hard for me to adapt because I am still at a young age, and I am used to a loud and active atmosphere back home that is due the fact that in Morocco everyone is sociable and talkative. In my country of origin, people are known by their hospitality and the way they serve tourists and foreigners. Fun fact about Fes, it has the oldest university in the world it is called <em>University of Quaraouiyine</em>, and it was founded by a woman called <em>Fatima al-Fihri</em>. Moreover, Fes is the 2<sup>nd</sup> largest city in the country which makes it a main direction for tourism.  </p>
        <p>Since I moved into Canada a lot changed in my life, like living alone, trying to make friends and a whole new network, it might be benefiting because it took me off my comfort zone and I started experiencing new things. But I still did not have the chance to have fun and live the exciting part of me moving here. And I always say:<blockquote>“I should appreciate the position I am in and move on to get better”</blockquote>  </p>
